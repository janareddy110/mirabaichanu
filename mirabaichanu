Early life

Saikhom Mirabai Chanu was born on 8 August 1994 in Nongpok Kakching, Imphal, Manipur, to a Hindu Meitei family. Her family identified her strength when she was just 12. She could easily carry a huge bundle of firewood home when her elder brother found it hard to even pick it up.[6]
Career

Chanu's first major breakthrough came at the Glasgow edition of the Commonwealth Games; she won the silver medal in the 48 kg weight category.[7]

Chanu qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympics in the women's 48 kg category. However, she failed to finish the event, owing to no successful lifts in any of her three attempts in the clean & jerk section.[8] In 2017, she won the Gold medal in the Women's 48 kg category by lifting a competition record 194 kg in total (85 kg snatch and 109 kg clean & jerk) in the 2017 World Weightlifting Championships held at Anaheim, CA, United States.[9]

In 2021, Mirabai Chanu became the 1st and only woman Indian weightlifter to qualify for the 2021 Summer Games by securing the 2nd position in the 49kg category.[10][11] The 27 year old, lifted 86 kg in snatch and then created the world record by lifting a massive 119 kg in the clean and jerk, for a total of 205 kg, which won her a Bronze medal and a ticket for Tokyo Olympics.[12]

Chanu lifted a total of 196 kg, 86 kg in Snatch and 110 kg in Clean and Jerk to win the first gold medal for India in the Commonwealth Games 2018.[13] En route to the medal, she broke the games record for the weight category; the effort also marked her personal best performance.[14] She won Bronze in Clean and Jerk at 49 kg Category in 2019 Asian Weightlifting Championships. The total weight of 199 kg was her best ever and she just missed out on a bronze medal as her Snatch weight was lower than the third place athlete, both of whom had an identical total. At the 2019 World Weightlifting Championships, Mirabai lifted a total of 201kgs (87kgs Snatch and 114kgs Clean & Jerk) to finish 4th.[15] This personal best total also created a new national record in the 49kg category. She broke her personal record again four months later when she lifted 203kgs (88kgs in Snatch and 115kg in Clean & Jerk,) in the 49kg category to win the gold medal at the 2020 Senior National Weightlifting Championships.[16]

Chanu won the silver medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, becoming the 1st Indian weightlifter to win silver in Olympics, winning a silver medal in 49kg weightlifting with a total lift of 202 kg.[17][18] Chanu managed to lift a total of 202 kg in the women's 49kg category to become the second Indian weightlifter after Karnam Malleswari to win an Olympic medal. A new Olympic record was registered by Mirabai Chanu with a successful lift of 115kg in clean and jerk.[19]
